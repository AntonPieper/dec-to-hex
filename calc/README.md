# What is this?

These scripts can do base10 mathematics.
They are based on [ecyrbe's implementation](https://github.com/ecyrbe/ts-calc).


I did modify these types to be more readable for me.
Because only division is used, everthing else not needed
does not work. This means that only addition,
subtraction, comparison and division is currently working.
